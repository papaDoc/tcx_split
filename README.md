Split Garmin 500 tcx files

Sometime it is possible to forget to Lap/Reset on you Garmin between two different ride/workout. The following code will split the given file where ever there is a time gap with motion bigger than the "max iterval time".

This is a work in progress. I'm planning to have a web site available where you will be able to provide the file and a zip with all the splitted file will be returned.
